This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a common off-by-one error that can occur when using PERFORM VARYING statements. The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from the incorrect placement of the counter increment statement.  The solution demonstrates the proper placement to avoid the off-by-one error.
